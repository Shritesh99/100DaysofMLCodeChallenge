# 100 Days of ML Code Challenge
## 100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell)
### Day 0 :- Gather all the tools for Data Science.
**Today's Work** :- Today I have installed all the tools and packages required for this challenge.
### Day 1 :- Data Preprocessing
#### Check out the code from [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/commit/16089b74f029151e98ba90ed54f92c52ed8d9643).
**Today's Work** :- I have completed the most crucial Data Preprocessing step on the following [dataset](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/blob/master/Data-Preprocessing/Data.csv).

### Day 2 :- Simple Linear Regression
#### Check out the code from [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/commit/e2894b2ce2d37c4dbd3aa64e0563a48c29936cfb).

**Today's work**:- I have applied Simple Linear Regression on the following [dataset](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/blob/master/Regression/Simple-Linear-Regression/Salary_Data.csv) and obtained following graphs for training and test prediction.

### Day 3 :- Multiple Linear Regression
#### Check out the code from [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/commit/a2fc8b097e0705e7ee2537d54722ca71040801d6).
**Today's work**:- I have applied Multiple Linear Regression on the following [dataset](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/blob/master/Regression/Multiple-Linear-Regression/50_Startups.csv) and also applied Backward Elimintion method to get the best model.

### Day 4 :- Polynomial Regression
#### Check out the code from [here](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/commit/89329b184190fe5648aff367c6c88509a1554605).
**Today's work**:- I have applied Polynomial Regression on the following [dataset](https://github.com/Shritesh99/100DaysofMLCodeChallenge/blob/master/Regression/Polynomial-Regression/Position_Salaries.csv) to predict weather a employee is telling truth or bluff about his salary and got the following graphs for Linear and Polynomial Regression.
